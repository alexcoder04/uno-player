# uno-player

A program that plays the popular Uno card game.

---

Current state: insert information via command line, it checks for possible cards
and puts a random one.

**Plan:**

Read card with Raspberry Pi camera (machine learning), play smart (not actually
using machine learning but simple rules, the game is not so complex).
